Selected Projects and Outcomes
==============================
## Subreddit Recommender System for Reddit users

[Link to Subreddit Recommendor Project](https://github.com/PankajMehar/Subreddit_Recommeder_system)

The goal of the project is to to predict possibly interesting subreddits to a user based on their comment history.
The hypothesis of the recommender model is, given an ordered sequence of user subreddit interactions, patterns will emerge that favour the discovery of paticular new subreddits given that historical user interaction sequence.

- Implemented the recommendor system using the SVD algorithm. 
- Verified the accuracy of the model by removing a subreddit from the user history and checking if the recommdation system did output the removed subreddit as a recommendation.
## Classification of Haptik user queries into right Business Verticals using NLP and ML techniques

The goal of the project was to detect the user intent and classify the user chat into the following categories - food,recharge,support,reminders,travel,nearby,movies,casual and other.

A chat can be classified into multiple categories Ex. “Are there any offers going on?”
This query could belong to all the domains in which transactions are possible ( travel, recharge, food, movies, home services, etc)
Thus it was a Multiclass and multilabel problem.

- Implemented a multi-label classifier using the training data. The classifier tagged all the possible domains (food, support etc) for each query using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random forest algorithms.
- Achieved a label accuracy of 94% and subset accuracy of 74%
## Predicting survival of passengers on the Titanic dataset

[Link to Titanic Project](https://github.com/PankajMehar/Titanic-)

In this project I investigated a dataset containing information about Titanic passengers by using NumPy and Pandas, which are two popular Python packages used for manipulating datasets.
The goal of this project was to get acquainted with said tools, learn about the different data structures (NumPy Arrays, Series and DataFrames) they offer,and practice the key steps on the whole data analysis process.

- I used Decision tree & Random forest algorithms to predict the percentage of passengers who survived.
- I am currently at 1829th rank for the given competition on Kaggle with an accuracy score of 79.42%.
